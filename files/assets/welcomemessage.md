# Welcome to Vidya Cafe! It's your taste in gaming. â˜•
# Here is some useful information to get you started:
---
### Themes
While the default dark theme looks great, you may want to try something more stylized like Win98, take a sip of the coffee theme, or enjoy the simplistic design of hackernews.

You can also change the theme color and site background (or completely remove it if you'd like)
#### Custom CSS
If you're feeling like tinkering, you can also input your own custom css in the settings

### Flairs
Since you're already in the settings, make sure to set a flair. It can be anything you want (as long as you keep it to 100 characters)

### Badges
We use them mainly for distinguishing users who participated in events or contributed to the source code, but we also give them out for other things like number of sips or donating

### Formatting and Polls
Vidya cafe uses markdown formatting with some things added on top. To learn more, see [the formatting guide](/formatting)

### Sorting algorithm
Keep in mind that comments on your post also contribute to its score!

### Setup and customization
If you'd like to customize your profile a bit, head on over to the [setup page](/setup). Everything you do there can be later configured in the settings. You can change numerous things, such as the website theme, your flair and profile banner
