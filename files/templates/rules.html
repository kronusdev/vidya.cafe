    <ul class="px-6 py-3"> 
        <li>
            <h5>Political content, unless explicitly related to video games, is prohibited.
            </h5>
            <p>For example, you may make posts and comment about a country deciding to ban loot boxes in video games, but you may not link to, make posts about, or comment about a video game developer or publisherâ€™s political beliefs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Excessive post or comment spamming is not allowed, doing so will result in potential strikes, and the spam in question being removed.
            </h5>
        </li>    
        <li>
            <h5>You may not post sexual or sexually suggestive material involving individuals under the age of 18, including fictitious content. Doing so will result in an immediate ban; pedophilia is not tolerated on this website.
            </h5>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Self promotion is allowed; however, you must clearly indicate in the post or title of your post that it is such. Excessive self promotion will be treated the same as spamming, which can result in content removal and strikes.
            </h5>
            <ul>
                <li><p>To avoid self promotion spam, you must contribute more to the community than simply pasting links to your own content.</p>
